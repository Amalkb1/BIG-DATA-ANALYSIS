# BIG-DATA-ANALYSIS
Big Data Analysis on Cars Dataset 🚗📊
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a cars dataset, showcasing various data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques. The project demonstrates how to handle real-world datasets, extract insights, and apply statistical methods to uncover patterns.

📂 Project Structure
Dataset: Cars Data.csv
Notebook: bigdata_analysis.ipynb
Output: Visualizations and analysis reports.
📊 Analysis Overview
Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on various car models, including:

Make, Model, and Type
Origin (e.g., Asia, Europe)
DriveTrain
Specifications: MSRP, Engine Size, Horsepower, MPG (City/Highway), Weight, etc.
Key Statistics:
Rows: 432
Columns: 15
Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and inconsistent data.
Data Analysis: Identify trends and relationships between features.
Visualization: Use plots to showcase insights.
🛠️ Methods and Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
numpy for numerical computations
Platform: Google Colab
🔍 Key Findings
Origin Analysis: Filtered cars by origin (Asia and Europe) for comparative analysis.
Weight Distribution: Identified heavier vehicles (>4000 lbs).
Fuel Efficiency: Adjusted and analyzed city MPG values.
📈 Sample Visualizations
Car Make Distribution:
Most common car brands in the dataset.
Weight vs. Horsepower:
Correlation between car weight and horsepower.
Price Distribution:
MSRP trends across origins.
